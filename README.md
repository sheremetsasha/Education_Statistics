# Education_Statistics
Here, in this project, we analyse data from 5 files to find countries with the highest potential for opening online education service. 

At the beginning, we check type of data, missing elements, correct simple mistakes. We identify types and information in each file. 

We do analyse of one of the files containing information about population with age corresponding to second education. We plot population number for different years (starting from 1970). And we find few first countries with larger population at the education age and select countries where the population is growing.
